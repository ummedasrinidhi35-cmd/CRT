# Collatz Sequence

## Problem Statement
```
The Collatz sequence is a sequence of numbers defined as follows:

Start with any positive integer 𝑛.

If 𝑛 is even, divide it by 2 → 𝑛 = 𝑛/2.

If 𝑛 is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 → 𝑛=3𝑛+1.

Repeat the process with the new value of 𝑛.

The sequence continues until 𝑛 becomes 1.
```
### Example
Input:6

Output: [6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
